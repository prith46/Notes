# 3289. The Two Sneaky Numbers of Digitville

In the town of **Digitville**, there was a list of numbers `nums` containing integers from **0 to n−1**.  
Each number was supposed to appear **exactly once** in the list. However, two mischievous numbers **appeared twice**, making the list longer than usual.
As the town detective, your task is to **find these two sneaky numbers**.  
Return an array of size **two** containing the two numbers (in any order).

---
`nums = [0,1,1,0]`
`[0,1]`

The numbers 0 and 1 each appear twice in the array.

# 717. 1-bit and 2-bit Characters
We have two special characters:
	• The first character can be represented by one bit 0.
	• The second character can be represented by two bits (10 or 11).
Given a binary array bits that ends with 0, return true if the last character must be a one-bit character.
 
Example 1:
Input: bits = [1,0,0]
Output: true
Explanation: The only way to decode it is two-bit character and one-bit character.
So the last character is one-bit character.

Example 2:
Input: bits = [1,1,1,0]
Output: false
Explanation: The only way to decode it is two-bit character and two-bit character.
So the last character is not one-bit character.
