**2260\. Minimum Consecutive Cards to Pick Up**

You are given an integer array cards where cards\[i\] represents the **value** of the ith card. A pair of cards are **matching** if the cards have the **same** value.

Return _the_ _**minimum**_ _number of_ _**consecutive**_ _cards you have to pick up to have a pair of_ _**matching**_ _cards among the picked cards._ If it is impossible to have matching cards, return -1.

**Example 1:**
Input: cards = [3,4,2,3,4,7]  
Output: 4  
Explanation: We can pick up the cards [3,4,2,3] which contain a matching pair of cards with value 3. 
Note that picking up the cards [4,2,3,4] is also optimal.   

**Example 2:**

Input: cards = [1,0,5,3]  
Output: -1  
Explanation: There is no way to pick up a set of consecutive cards that contain a pair of matching cards
