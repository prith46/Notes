## Container With Most Water

Given N non-negative integers A[0], A[1], ..., A[N-1] , where each represents a point at coordinate (i, A[i]).
N vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, A[i]) and (i, 0).
Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water. You need to return this maximum area.

Input :
A = [1, 5, 4, 3]

Output :
 6

## **Closest pair from sorted arrays**

Given two sorted arrays of distinct integers, **A** and **B**, and an integer **C**, find and return the pair whose **sum is closest to C** and the pair has one element from each array. More formally, find A\[i\] and B\[j\] such that abs((A\[i\] + B\[j\]) - C) has minimum value.
If there are multiple solutions find the one with **minimum i** and even if there are multiple values of j for the same i then return the one with **minimum j.**
Return an array with two elements {A\[i\], B\[j\]}.

Input :
A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]   
B = [2, 4, 6, 8]  
C = 9

Output :
[1, 8]
