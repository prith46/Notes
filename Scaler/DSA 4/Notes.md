### ðŸ“Œ Why start at `i = n/2 - 1` in heap building?

In a 0-indexed array, all nodes from index `n/2` to `n-1` are leaf nodes â€” they donâ€™t need heapify.  
The last non-leaf node is at index `n/2 - 1`, so we start heapifying from there.

#### ðŸ§® Example:
For `n = 10`:  
`n/2 = 5` â†’ start at `i = 4` (`n/2 - 1`)


Minimum largest element
Given an array A of N numbers, you have to perform B operations. In each operation, you have to pick any one of the N elements and add the original value(value stored at the index before we did any operations) to its current value. You can choose any of the N elements in each operation.
Perform B operations in such a way that the largest element of the modified array(after B operations) is minimized.
Find the minimum possible largest element after B operations.
