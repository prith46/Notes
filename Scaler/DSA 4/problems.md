## 2. Flipkart's Challenge in Effective Inventory ManagementSolved

In the recent expansion into grocery delivery, Flipkart faces a crucial challenge in effective inventory management. Each grocery item on the platform carries its own expiration date and profit margin, represented by two arrays, **A** and **B** of size **N.** **A\[i\]** denotes the time left before expiration date for the **ith** item, and **B\[i\]** denotes profit margin for the **ith** item. To mitigate potential losses due to expiring items, Flipkart is seeking a strategic solution.
