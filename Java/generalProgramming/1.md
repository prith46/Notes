## 2. In-Place Removal in ArrayLists

When removing elements in an `ArrayList` in Java, we must be careful about **index shifting**. Hereâ€™s a guide on how to remove elements efficiently **forward** and **backward**.

## ðŸ”¹ Forward Removal (Left to Right)
**Key Issue:** Removing elements shifts all subsequent elements left, so we need to **stay on the same index** after a removal.

### âœ… Correct Approach (Using `i++` After Removal)
```java
for (int i = 0; i < A.size(); ) {  // No i++ in loop header
    A.remove(i);  // Removes current element
    i++;  // Move to next element (since elements shifted left)
}
```

### **Backward Removal Approach (Alternative, Easier)**
Going **backward** avoids shifting issues entirely.

```java
for (int i = A.size() - 1; i >= 0; i -= 2) {  
    A.remove(i);  
}
```

- Removing from the **end** prevents index shifts from affecting unprocessed elements.
- Since we decrement `i` by 2 (`i -= 2`), we skip every other element.
